# C++ Masterclass From Fundamentals to Advanced Data Structures

Welcome to the C++ Masterclass, your all-in-one resource for becoming proficient in C++. This repository is designed to be a practical, hands-on guide, with a focus on clear explanations and well-commented code examples. We'll start with the building blocks of the language and progress to advanced topics crucial for competitive programming and software development.

Why C++?
C++ is a powerful, high-performance language used in a wide range of applications, including game development, high-frequency trading systems, operating systems, and embedded systems. Its efficiency and control over system resources make it an essential skill for any serious programmer.

Roadmap
Our learning journey is broken down into logical sections, with each folder containing code examples and explanations.

Fundamentals: Master the basics of C++, including:

Input/Output Operations (cin, cout)

Variables, Data Types, and Operators

Control Flow (if-else, loops)

Functions and Pointers

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Dive into the core principles of OOP, a paradigm that structures code for reusability and efficiency.

Classes and Objects

Constructors and Destructors

Inheritance and Polymorphism

Encapsulation and Abstraction

Standard Template Library (STL): Explore the powerful tools C++ offers for managing data.

Containers (vector, list, map, set)

Iterators

Algorithms (sort, find, binary_search)

Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): This is where we build the core logic for solving complex problems.

Fundamental Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

Advanced Data Structures: Trees (Binary, AVL), Heaps, and Graphs.

Essential Algorithms: Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching, and Greedy Algorithms.
